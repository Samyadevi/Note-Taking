DESCRIPTION :

* The "My Reading Notes App" is a client-side web application designed to help users organize their books and manage personal notes associated with each book. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers a clean, responsive, and intuitive interface for tracking your reading journey and insights.

** Core Features:

* Book Management:

Add Books: Users can easily add new books by providing a title, author, and an optional link (e.g., to Wikipedia or a book-related page).

View Book Details: Clicking on a book in the sidebar displays its title, author, and a prominent "Read Online" button if a link was provided.

Delete Books: Books can be deleted, which also automatically removes all associated notes, ensuring data integrity.

Search/Filter: A search bar allows users to quickly find books by title or author, dynamically updating the book list in real-time.

* Note Management:

Create Notes: Users can create new notes either directly from the main header or specifically for a selected book from its detail view.

Edit Notes: Existing notes can be edited, allowing for updates to their title, content, and even the associated book.

Delete Notes: Individual notes can be deleted.

Markdown Support: Notes support Markdown formatting (e.g., headings, bold, italics, lists, code blocks, quotes, tables, images), providing a rich text editing experience. Users can toggle between "Edit" (raw Markdown input) and "Preview" (rendered Markdown) modes.

Note Organization: Notes are displayed categorized by their associated book, making it easy to find insights related to a specific read. They are also sorted by their last updated time.

Note Viewing: When a note is selected, it's displayed in a dedicated viewer, showing its title, content (rendered Markdown), the associated book (with a clickable link back to the book's details), and timestamps for creation and last update.

* Data Persistence:

Local Storage: All book and note data is automatically saved and retrieved using the browser's localStorage. This ensures that all user-added content persists across browser sessions, even after closing and reopening the application.

* Technical Stack:

HTML5: Provides the semantic structure of the application.

CSS3: Styles the application with a modern, professional, and light-themed design, featuring soft colors, subtle shadows, and responsive adjustments for various screen sizes.

JavaScript (ES6+): Powers all interactive functionalities, including DOM manipulation, data management, event handling, and local storage integration.

Marked.js: A third-party JavaScript library used for parsing Markdown content into HTML, enabling the rich note-taking feature.

Google Material Symbols: Integrated for scalable and visually appealing icons throughout the interface.

* User Experience:
The application prioritizes a clean, uncluttered user interface. The sidebar provides quick navigation between books and their notes, while the main content area dynamically switches between welcome messages, book details, note editing, and note viewing modes. Responsive design ensures a consistent experience across desktop and mobile devices.
